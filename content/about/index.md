title: About Me
---
Hi there! I'm Kenny, a DevOps Engineer based in Belgium. I'm passionate about open source tech and have hands-on experience in cloud computing, automation, and infrastructure as code.

Beyond work, I enjoy a range of hobbies like motorsports, analog photography, retro gaming, and DIY electronics. I might write about any of these interests or whatever else catches my eye.

My biggest claim to fame is that I once asked Randal Munroe a [dumb question](https://what-if.xkcd.com/58/) in 2013 on his [What If?](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) blog. He answered it in the [What If? book](https://xkcd.com/what-if/), so I guess you could say I'm a published author now. ðŸ˜„

I don't write a lot of code in my free time, but sometimes I hack something together in Python or Bash. You can find some of my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/vdmkenny).
